# Architecture Decision record by Tom√°s Caceres

# Coupons App

## Status

Proposed.

## Context

We don't have a system for managing coupons for a store.

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
We are doing a system for coupons managing app with Django version 3.2. We decided to use Django because it provides a default admin panel, which is super fast to manage; it has a great set of libraries also, for example the validators; and finally, it's good for SEO. 

## Consequences

It becomes easier to create, read, update and delete coupons for a store.
